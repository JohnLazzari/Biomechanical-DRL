Save the activities of the experimental data, nusim, open-loop RNN, emg and kinematics in the training and testing folders
in the following format

1. Save the activities of each model in a dict with

	i. keys should correspond to the condition number
	ii. values should correspond to the neural activity as a numpy array with the following shape: [timepoints, number of neurons/dimensions]

2. Name the activities of the models as follows:

	For Training, save the activities in the Training folder with following names
		
		i. exp_train.pkl  
		ii. nusim_train.pkl
		iii. RNN_train.pkl
		iii. emg_train.pkl
		iv. kin_train.pkl

	For Testing, save the activities in the Testing folder with following names

		i. exp_test.pkl  
		ii. nusim_test.pkl
		iii. RNN_test.pkl
		iii. emg_test.pkl
		iv. kin_test.pkl

3. For CCA and PCA, run CCA.py
4. For LRA, run LRA.py
